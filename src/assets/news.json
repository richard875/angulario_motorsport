    "description": "With the coronavirus lockdown in place, there’s little for the F1 drivers to do except train, compete online and work out their strategies for when real-world racing resumes. And Williams’ George Russell, for one, has already got a cunning plan to benefit from any rustiness in his rivals when the 2020 F1 season finally gets underway…",

    "title": "‘Rusty’ first few races ‘an opportunity’ for Williams, says Russell",
    "body": "Speaking from his home in England on Formula 1’s brand new F1 Nation podcast, Russell revealed that, aside from sim racing, building his own home gym, learning how to cut hair and doing the garden, he’s been training hard to get himself prepped for the first Grands Prix of the year – but conceded that however much he and his fellow drivers trained, the first few race weekends would still be “incredibly hard” physically. “[The lockdown] just gives myself the chance to nail my fitness even more,” said Russell, “but I think for all of us, it’s going to be incredibly hard. You can train as much as you want, but you obviously lose race fitness. 'Running around the garden or doing weights in the gym is not the same as driving at 200mph around Silverstone, and that g-force is going to hit us hard that first practice session when we get back. But like I said, I’m doing everything I can to be prepared for that moment.'"
